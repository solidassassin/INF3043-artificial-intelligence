### This is of course very ineffective with lots of flaws. Let's quicky go through why I made it like this.

- Brute force solution was requested
- Iterative dfs was specifically requested
- Previous states aren't checked because that was requested
- The point was to check how a computer would deal with all
these combinations (yes, especially the constantly repeating ones)
- I'm aware of the repeated calling of functions,
was too lazy to shift in a different direction (will fix)
